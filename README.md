## Travis London

**Chief Architect | Systems Designer | Technical Leader**

I build systems that stay reliable as they grow complex.  
Over two decades in software have taken me from early Linux servers to leading architecture for distributed, real-time platforms.  
My focus is on reproducible processes, verifiable deployments, and frameworks that let teams scale without losing clarity or traceability.

I’m self-taught, grounded in model-driven and domain-driven design, and drawn to the structure behind sustainable engineering organizations.  
Recent work has centered on autonomous SaaS frameworks, governance protocols, and systems that emphasize auditability over opacity.

I believe architecture is less about control and more about stewardship—creating the conditions for engineers and products to grow safely.

**Focus areas:**

- Systems architecture and governance
- Distributed and event-driven design
- Cloud infrastructure and security (AWS, CI/CD, container scanning)
- Model-driven and reproducible development practices
- Technical mentorship and cross-team coordination

Outside of work, I keep things simple: family, golf, and the occasional project that reminds me how much there still is to learn.
