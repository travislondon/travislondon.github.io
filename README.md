## Welcome to my central hub

Here you will find further information about myself.  This includes everything, at least that I would like to share :).  

### Personal Life

Growing up I always dreamed of being a Doctor or a Lawyer.  I believe this was a dream of my family rather than mine.  This was also based entirely on money.  As I got older those dreams dissipated as I realized the money was not worth the stress.  The next big dream my family had for me was to get into the computer industry as they knew it was the next big thing.  I agreed with this idea which led me to my professional life.    

### Professional Life

This part of my life began earlier than the computer industry as I have always been a professional.  Whether it was while washing dishes or moving rock and trimming trees.  Though what is considered professional by most for me started with the computer industry.  I completed high school a year early to study the system adminstration side of computers.  After a little over a year I began my career with the same group of people that I have been with since.  

The start of it all came when a small company contacted me to be their sole system administrator.  This was great for me as a start.  It was unnerving for the interview, but once work began I realized how great the people were and how much I could learn.  After solving a lot of issues that had been present when joining (ancient servers and networks, etc.), I decided to make a change and gave my notice.  After a few months for reasons other than my own, I contacted the company asking if my position was still available.  The answer was "No, but I would like you to come work for us as a software engineer".  While a suprise to me I accepted in order to learn more.  This led to a new era of computers for me.  15 years later I cannot imagine going back.

I have worked for a small company, a large corporation, a start-up and now am an independent contractor.  I have enjoyed all of these roles.  I was able to travel around the country as well as out of country a couple of times.  I have met many different people from top to bottom.
